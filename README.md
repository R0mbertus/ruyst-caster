# ruyst-caster
Various raycasters made in Rust using piston-rs. The basic idea is for it to be
a maze in various levels of raycaster algorithms, to visually see the difference
between the algorithms, wether that be in graphics or code.

## Installation
Thanks to the cargo tool, it should be as simple as installing rust and then
running `cargo run`, no further installs needed.

## Motivation
With another summer break coming up and me not having a lot to do I thought I'd
work through my list of potential project ideas, with my first choice being a
raycaster. This high intrest is due to the interesting math behind raycasting
and me wanting to have some experience with how basic graphics work.

## Project outline
This is a rough roadmap of what I'm planning to do in this project. Do note the
*rought* part as the further along the list goes, the more likely it is to be
subject to change.

[x] - Project setup
[x] - Simple barebones raycaster
    [x] - Fix fisheye problem
[ ] - DDA raycaster
    [ ] - Distance shadows
    [ ] - floor and sky colors
[ ] - Wall textures
    [ ] - floor and sky textures
[ ] - ???

## Feedback
I'm very much still a novice in Rust and I'd say programming in general, so any
feedback or wise old advice is greatly appreaciated.
