# ruyst-caster
Various raycasters made in Rust using bevy. The basic idea is for it to be
a simple wolfenstein looking maze, with some other basic features.

## Installation
Thanks to the cargo tool, it should be as simple as installing rust and then
running `cargo run`, no further installs needed.

## Motivation
With another summer break coming up and me not having a lot to do I thought I'd
work through my list of potential project ideas, with my first choice being a
raycaster. This high intrest is due to the interesting math behind raycasting
and me wanting to have some experience with how basic graphics work.

## Project outline
This is a rough roadmap of what I'm planning to do in this project. Do note the
*rought* part as the further along the list goes, the more likely it is to be
subject to change.

- [x] Project setup
- [x] Simple barebones raycaster
    - [x] Fix fisheye problem
    - [x] Floor and sky colors
    - [x] Shadows for distance
- [x] Wall textures
    - [ ] Floor casting and textures
    - [ ] Roof casting and textures
- [ ] DDA raycaster
- [ ] *future stuff...*

## Feedback
I'm very much still a novice in Rust and I'd say programming in general, so any
feedback or wise old advice is greatly appreaciated.
